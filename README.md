**DISCONTINUED** I no longer game on Android and have no intention of maintaining this port.
Have a look at [Delta Touch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opentouchgaming.deltatouch&hl=en_US)
for a well-maintained GZDoom port to Android. 

# GZDoom for Android

A fork of D-Touch that aims to be the de facto port of GZDoom on Android.

## Building
    git submodule update --init
    ./build.sh
    ./gradlew assemble

## Credits
Major thanks to Emile Belanger (Beloko Games) for his work on D-Touch and the rest of the OpenGames suite.
